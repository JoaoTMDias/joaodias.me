  easter eggs.

## Accessibility Considerations

Despite being a fun, playful website with easter eggs, accessibility was not compromised. The site was built with:

- Semantic HTML structure throughout
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility - easter eggs were implemented in a way that doesn't interfere with assistive technologies
- High contrast text and background colors for readability
- Accessible forms and navigation

The easter eggs (fart sounds) were implemented in a way that doesn't break the user experience for those using assistive technologies. The site maintains WCAG 2.1 AA compliance while still delivering an engaging, fun experience.

## Technical Approach

Built with:

- **Next.js** - For server-side rendering and static site generation
- **Styled Components** - For component-scoped styling
- **Cypress** - For end-to-end testing
- **Jest** and **Testing Library** - For unit and component testing

The project was developed over a weekend with Henrique Macedo handling the visual design and branding, while I focused on implementation and testing. The site needed to balance serious content with playful visuals, which required careful attention to both functionality and accessibility.

## Process

The project was a quick turnaround - developed over a weekend. Henrique handled the visual design while I implemented the Next.js site and ensured all interactions were accessible.

Testing was done with Cypress for end-to-end flows and Jest/Testing Library for component testing. Accessibility was validated using automated tools and manual keyboard navigation testing.

The easter eggs were added as a fun way to spread word about the site, but implemented in a way that doesn't interfere with accessibility.

## Results & Impact

The conference was a success with many attendees and positive feedback. The website successfully balanced serious content with engaging visuals and interactive elements.

The project demonstrates that accessibility and fun can coexist - the easter eggs don't compromise the site's usability for users with disabilities.
