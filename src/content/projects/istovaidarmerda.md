shortDescription: A website for an online pandemic-centric conference. Includes some smelly easter eggs.
description: At the height of the pandemic lockdown, an online conference focused on the not-so-good stuff that was happening amongst several areas of society. And I build it's website.
accessibilityConsiderations: |
  Despite being a fun, playful website with easter eggs, accessibility was not compromised. The site was built with:

  - Semantic HTML structure throughout
  - Proper heading hierarchy
  - Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
  - Screen reader compatibility - easter eggs were implemented in a way that doesn't interfere with assistive technologies
  - High contrast text and background colors for readability
  - Accessible forms and navigation

  The easter eggs (fart sounds) were implemented in a way that doesn't break the user experience for those using assistive technologies. The site maintains WCAG 2.1 AA compliance while still delivering an engaging, fun experience.
technicalApproach: |
  Built with:
  - **Next.js** - For server-side rendering and static site generation
  - **Styled Components** - For component-scoped styling
  - **Cypress** - For end-to-end testing
  - **Jest** and **Testing Library** - For unit and component testing

  The project was developed over a weekend with Henrique Macedo handling the visual design and branding, while I focused on implementation and testing. The site needed to balance serious content with playful visuals, which required careful attention to both functionality and accessibility.
process: |
  The project was a quick turnaround - developed over a weekend. Henrique handled the visual design while I implemented the Next.js site and ensured all interactions were accessible.

  Testing was done with Cypress for end-to-end flows and Jest/Testing Library for component testing. Accessibility was validated using automated tools and manual keyboard navigation testing.

  The easter eggs were added as a fun way to spread word about the site, but implemented in a way that doesn't interfere with accessibility.
results: |
  The conference was a success with many attendees and positive feedback. The website successfully balanced serious content with engaging visuals and interactive elements.

  The project demonstrates that accessibility and fun can coexist - the easter eggs don't compromise the site's usability for users with disabilities.

## The Problem

Picture this: It is January of 2021 and, In Portugal, people are starting to face the reality of having opened stores and relaxed a bit on Christmas and New year's eve. Hospitals are becoming full of patients in serious respiratory conditions, ambulances queuing at the entrances in every health facility, older and younger dropping like flies. The images we've seen before in Italy and Spain, they were now happening here. No place to bury the dead, no one know what was going to happen next.

A vaccine was yet to be given to the population, so everyone was locked up at home, scared about what turned out to be a violent outbreak of Covid-19 that took almost two months to pass.

We all knew that this virus was something not be taken lightly. TVs were constantly blasting news about the numbers of infected and the dead. All the time, everytime, everywhere.

At the same time, on social media, there was also this frustrating vibe of toxic-positivity, with 'everything's going to be allright' and 'we're all in this together'.

There were a lot of us that knew that this trend was bullshit. We prefer the truth, not some made up falsehoods about the status of the pandemic or, on the other hand, over-exaggerated news coverage.

Health care professionals were in dire situations, exhausted, scared and not being well taken care of by the government. People in other areas such as arts and culture were out of work since 2020 - no live concerts, no theatre, not cinema, no nothing. Many of them and their families were in very hard situations.

These people all needed to vent their opinions.

That's when Sónia Teles had the idea to organize an online conference where people from different areas could gather and voice their opinions about their issues without feeling guilty about speaking out or facing the consequences of the cancel-culture. She reached out to Henrique Macedo (a friend of mine) and me to develop a website for the conference

## The Solution

She asked us for a website where the topic was serious, but the visuals were not. So, something fun. And fun we had, indeed.

For the tools, we went with Next.js, Styled Components and Cypress. I think we spent like a weekend working on this. Henrique is a friend of mine, we've known each other since our college days, and we work very well together. He developed the visuals for the whole branding/website and I did most of the implementation and testing.

Given the opportunity, I came up with the idea to add a couple of easter-eggs on the website, something that only developers and curious people would get to, but would help to spread-out the word about the webiste.

Mainly because I don't take myself very seriously and I was waiting my whole life for the perfect opportunity to add a couple of fart sounds to a side-project. 🤣

The conference turned out to be a success, with a lot of attendees and good feedback.
