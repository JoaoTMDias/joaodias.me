It enabled me to quickly pick two colours, get an instant contrast ratio score as well as let me know which WCAG levels it passed and which ones it failed. It was simple, did the job and had a native look-and-feel to it.",
            "When switching to Windows I went to the Windows Store and looked up for the same type of app. There were some results, sure, but I didn't find any that did the same, with the same ease of use and native look-and-feel.",
            "There are also dozens of Chrome and Firefox browser extensions, sure, but nothing really 'good' for the desktop and that respects the user interface design guidelines for that specific environment.",

            "Finally, the features of the app are all built around getting as much relevant information as fast as possible so, when choosing two colours, you have a 5 star rating as well as a check/failed score for AA and AAA levels for large and regular font sizes",

            "One of the most important goals of the app is to get as quickly as possible to a place where you could read articles from your favourite news sources, without too much messing around with login forms, passwords and all sorts of permissions. Just free information, that's it.",
            "Apple News, a service launched by the fruit company, is a way for people to read on their fruit devices. Unfortunately, it is curated by Apple and isn't available to Android devices, only on Apple devices, and not even all of them (Although a colleague of mine actually discovered how to open Apple News in Portugal, using MacOS Mojave).",
            "Google News is another free tool but, as much as I like a few thinks that they create, it still lacks that feeling of open-ness and freedom of choice.",
            "I want something that I could share with others, so that they could use for themselves, without business boundaries.",
            "I have tried Swift and Java in the past. I felt like I removed myself from the visual side of things whilst learning the basics of those two.",
            "I like to write software with good-old web standards: HTML, CSS and Javascript. They are old, they are new. They are powerful, but easy to manage. They are accessible by default and always evolving.",
            "I went with React Native as it seemed like the best choice for this app. I kew React, and React Native seemed like the perfect way to target two operating systems myself. Plus, all the layout is made with CSS-like syntax, there are a lot of cool features to play with.",
            "I'm using React Native with Expo, Native Base and Axios.",
            "One very cool feature of doing layouts React Native, is the ability to think of different screen sizes in the most logical way: using media queries. For that I used a library called react-native-extended-stylesheets, which made the process to build something that looks good on a hand-held device or a tablet, a breeze.",
            "For navigation i'm using React Navigation 2.0 and for the icons in the bottom bars, I'm using SVG icons instead of PNG's.",
            "The development is still in progress, but you can check out the source code here."
