It enabled me to quickly pick two colours, get an instant contrast ratio score and let me know which WCAG levels it passed and which ones it failed. It was simple, did the job and had a native look and feel.",
            "When switching to Windows, I went to the Microsoft Store and looked up the same type of app. There were some results, sure, but I didn't find any that did the same, with the same ease of use and native look and feel. I felt a little dissapointed.",

            "And besides, I've always wanted to try out building a native app with Electron JS and use its Node API to communicate between system-level APIs and the user interface (at the time, the Eyedropper API isn't correctly supported in Electron for Windows)",

            "I tried to build somewhat of an inline panel right next to the app's textarea but, as it turned out, that wasn't so simple to do. For starters, Google didn't even use a native textarea, but a div with 'contenteditable' turned on. And then, there was simply no unique identifier on that node to make it easier to inject my extension panel. That would essentially mean that I would locked up to the implementation, and the minute it changed, my app would break.",

            "The interface was simple but supported a toolbar, copy-to-clipboard and even dark and light themes. It was simple, but did the job. It goes without saying, but accessibility was at the top of my priorities.",
            "I also tried out Cypress component testing, a relatively-new Cypress feature at the time, and I went on board with it.",
            "And, of course, I learned a lot from it! Especially to appreciate how better it is to write tests that run in the browser rather than using tools like Jest and JSDOM, which are quasi-implementations of a browser but are a pain in the ass to configure, and you don't get to see the tests running in a browser.",
            "With Cypress, you use the syntax you typically use with integration or end-to-end tests, but instead of rendering a page, you mount a component on the browser. It is way simpler, and actually I caught a couple of bugs that I wouldn't be able to catch if I was using Jest as a test runner.",
            "Note: At the time of this posting it seems that Google has already built in an inline editor. Nevertheless, this project served me well for several months and taught me a lot about other React alternatives and Vite too."

In the realm of these Silicon-Valley types of companies, it's so easy to fall into that cycle of misinformation we all came to know, one way or another. Most times, online users only read what they think is the truth. It might be, but they never seek the 'real information' by comparing it from different sources.",
            "This movement of false information spreading, fake news and bad journalism was (and still is) being fed by the lack of tools to compare news articles. In this era of click-bait articles, the newspapers are also to blame.",

People should have access to an easy, free way to read news on their mobile phone, but at the same time, be allowed to choose from a wide variety of news outlets and also search for specific topics to see what all parts say about one thing'. To an old-internet-fart like me, that's what real democracy sounds like and the real purpose of the web.",

            "In the past, I've messed up a little bit with Swift and Java. I felt like I removed myself from the visual side of things whilst learning the basics of those two. Or maybe I just sucked at it, I don't know.",

            "So I went with the progressive webapp approach. Something that could be accessed in all browsers and could even be loaded up offline.",
            "I chose Gatsby, styled components, Jest and Cypress. I experimented a bit with Service Workers, with the Vibration API, with - at the time - fresh CSS features, such as scroll snapping",
            "One cool thing of doing layouts for a progressive Web app is that, while developing, you don't think about mobile Operating Systems, but rather the content presentation and how it looks good on an array of different screen sizes. You can experiment with fluid typography, with media queries, Service Workers, caching stuff for offline usage, etc.",
